###Scientific Calculator
A Calculator That Provides a range of Different Mathematical operations 

##as an example it supports operations as :

- Basic operations ( Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division)
- Trignometric operations ( Sin, Cos, Tan, Sec, Csc, Cot)
- Logartithmic with Different bases ( Base : 10, 2, exp(ln) )
- Modulus
- Factorial
- Absolute
- different order roots
- Powers of numbers

##Some Features inside operations : 
- Easy and simple interface to deal with
- Choose number of operands for calculations for non-single operand operations
- Different order of powers and roots 
- Mathematical Restrictions on inputs are applied as possible

##Coding Creteria : 
- A function for each operation is implemented independently to enable ease of debugging errors
  and enhancement code readiability and organization
- A user friendly functions is added to ease the usage as Welcome, interface,...
- Main function to control the operation of the calculator 
- Despite of math library (for some trignometric and other functions hard to code), 
  All mathematical function operations are written from scratch

##Future Work : 
other Features anf various enhancement could be added to help srengthen and given more value
for the project
